# Local Development Guide - Heritage H2GP STEAM Website

## Quick Start (Recommended)

### For macOS/Linux:
```bash
./start-local.sh
```

### For Windows:
```cmd
start-local.bat
```

Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:8000**

---

## Manual Setup Options

### Option 1: Python HTTP Server (Recommended)
```bash
# Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Python 2 (if Python 3 not available)
python -m http.server 8000
```

### Option 2: Node.js HTTP Server
```bash
# Install globally (one time)
npm install -g http-server

# Run server
http-server -p 8000

# Or use npx (no installation needed)
npx http-server -p 8000
```

### Option 3: PHP Built-in Server
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

### Option 4: Direct File Opening
Simply double-click `index.html` or drag it to your browser.
*Note: Some features may not work due to CORS restrictions.*

```
http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:8000
```

To find your IP:
- **macOS**: `ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1`

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 8000 is busy, try:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Then visit http://localhost:8080
```

### Python Not Found
1. **Install Python**: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. **Use Node.js**: `npx http-server -p 8000`
3. **Use PHP**: `php -S localhost:8000`
4. **Direct file**: Open `index.html` in browser

### CORS Issues
If opening `index.html` directly causes issues:
- Use any of the server options above
- CORS restrictions prevent some features from working with `file://` protocol

### 3D Models Not Loading
- Ensure you're using a server (not direct file opening)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify STL files exist in `assets/models/` folder

## Development Tips

### Making Changes
1. Edit HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files
2. Save changes
3. Refresh browser (Ctrl+R / Cmd+R)
4. Changes appear immediately

### Browser Developer Tools
- **F12** or **Ctrl+Shift+I** (Windows/Linux)
- **Cmd+Option+I** (macOS)
- Use Console tab to see any JavaScript errors

### Mobile Simulation
Use browser dev tools:
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Click device icon (mobile/tablet view)
3. Select different device sizes

## Next Steps

After local testing, you can:
1. **Deploy to Netlify**: Push changes to GitHub (auto-deploys)
2. **Share locally**: Use your IP address for same-network access
3. **Make modifications**: Edit files and test changes immediately

## Live Website
The production version is available at: https://heritage-h2gp-steam.netlify.app

Compare your local version with the live site to ensure everything works correctly before deploying changes.
