# Heritage H2GP STL Model Setup Guide

## Overview
Your website now supports **permanent server-side STL storage** in addition to the existing upload functionality. This means your Heritage H2GP club car models can be permanently available on the website without requiring uploads.

## Current System Features

### ‚úÖ What's Already Working
- **Permanent Model Selection**: Pre-configured Heritage H2GP models available instantly
- **Upload Functionality**: Users can still upload their own STL files
- **Cloud Storage**: Uploaded files are stored in AWS S3
- **Model Persistence**: Models persist across page reloads
- **Japanese Street Environment**: 3D scene with buildings and street details
- **No Spinning Animation**: STL models remain stationary as requested

## Adding Your STL Files Permanently

### Step 1: Prepare Your STL Files
Place your Heritage H2GP STL files in the `assets/models/` directory with these recommended names:
- `heritage-h2gp-2024.stl` - Your latest competition car
- `heritage-h2gp-prototype.stl` - Early prototype design
- `heritage-h2gp-chassis.stl` - Chassis component

### Step 2: Update Model Configuration
Edit `assets/models/models-config.json` to match your actual models:

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "id": "heritage-h2gp-2024",
      "name": "Heritage H2GP Car 2024",
      "description": "Our latest hydrogen-powered RC car design for the 2024 competition season",
      "filename": "heritage-h2gp-2024.stl",
      "category": "competition",
      "year": 2024,
      "isDefault": true
    },
    {
      "id": "heritage-h2gp-prototype",
      "name": "Heritage H2GP Prototype",
      "description": "Early prototype design showcasing our initial hydrogen fuel cell integration",
      "filename": "heritage-h2gp-prototype.stl",
      "category": "prototype",
      "year": 2023,
      "isDefault": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Deploy Updated Files
After adding your STL files and updating the configuration:

```bash
cd netlify-deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

## File Structure
```
netlify-deploy/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ models/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models-config.json          # Model configuration
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ heritage-h2gp-2024.stl      # Your STL files
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ heritage-h2gp-prototype.stl
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ heritage-h2gp-chassis.stl
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js                           # Updated with permanent model support
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css                          # Updated with model selection UI
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html                          # Main website
