└── assets/
    ├── actual-mclaren-p1.jpg
    ├── mclaren-p1-replacement.jpg
    ├── yellow-mclaren-p1.jpg
    ├── yellow-mclaren.jpg
    └── models/
        ├── heritage-h2gp-2024.stl
        └── models-config.json
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist
After uploading all files:
- [ ] Visit your InfinityFree URL (e.g., yoursite.infinityfreeapp.com)
- [ ] Check main website loads correctly
- [ ] Test navigation menu works
- [ ] Verify images display properly
- [ ] Test attendance system link
- [ ] Try attendance system with secret code "Pagani"
- [ ] Check 3D model viewer works
- [ ] Test photo upload feature
- [ ] Verify all pages load without 404 errors

## 💡 Upload Tips

### File Manager Upload:
1. Select multiple files at once for faster upload
2. Upload the large STL file last (it's 98MB)
3. Make sure folder structure is exactly as shown above

### Alternative: Use FTP Client
If File Manager is slow:
1. Get FTP credentials from InfinityFree control panel
2. Use FileZilla or similar FTP client
3. Upload all files maintaining the folder structure

## 🚨 Important Notes
- **File names are case-sensitive** - make sure they match exactly
- **Don't skip the assets folder** - images and 3D models won't work without it
- **The STL file is large (98MB)** - it may take time to upload
- **Test after each major section** - upload HTML files first and test

## 🎯 Success Indicators
✅ Main website loads at your InfinityFree URL
✅ All images display correctly
✅ Attendance system accessible and works with "Pagani" code
✅ 3D model viewer shows the Heritage H2GP car
✅ No 404 errors in browser console

Your STEAM website will be fully functional on InfinityFree once all files are uploaded! 🚀
