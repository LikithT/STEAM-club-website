6. `netlify.toml`
7. `upload-image-to-aws.js`

### Phase 3: Create Folder Structure
**Create these folders in htdocs:**
1. Create `css` folder
2. Create `js` folder  
3. Create `assets` folder
4. Inside `assets`, create `images` subfolder
5. Inside `assets`, create `models` subfolder

### Phase 4: Upload CSS Files
**Upload to the `css/` folder:**
- `styles.css`
- `attendance-styles.css`
- `login-styles.css`

### Phase 5: Upload JavaScript Files
**Upload to the `js/` folder:**
- `script.js` (contains all CAD model functionality)
- `attendance-script.js`
- `login-script.js`
- `student-attendance-script.js`

### Phase 6: Upload Images

### Phase 7: Upload CAD Models (IMPORTANT!)
**Upload to the `assets/models/` folder:**
1. `models-config.json` - **Upload this first**
2. `heritage-h2gp-2024.stl.gz` - **Compressed version (19MB)**
3. `heritage-h2gp-2024.stl` - **Full model (93MB) - Be patient!**

## ðŸŽ® CAD Model Features That Will Work

Once deployed, your website will have:

### âœ… STL Model Loading
- **Automatic loading** of Heritage H2GP Car 2024
- **Compression support** - loads .stl.gz files efficiently
- **Fallback system** - tries compressed first, then uncompressed
- **Real-time decompression** using pako.js

### âœ… Interactive 3D Viewer
- **Orbit controls** - mouse/touch navigation
- **Wireframe mode** - toggle mesh view
- **Explode view** - separate model components
- **Reset view** - return to default position
- **Japanese street environment** - realistic context

### âœ… STL Upload System
- **Drag & drop interface** for user uploads
- **Heritage model library** with permanent models
- **Model metadata** management
- **Local storage** persistence

## ðŸ”§ Upload Tips for Large Files

### For the STL Files:
- **Upload during off-peak hours** (early morning/late night)
- **Be patient** - the 93MB STL file will take 5-10 minutes
- **Upload compressed version first** (.stl.gz) - it's much faster
- **Don't close browser** during large file uploads

### If Upload Fails:
1. Try uploading just the compressed `.stl.gz` file
2. The website will work with just the compressed version
3. Use FTP if file manager is too slow (get FTP credentials from dashboard)

## âœ… Testing Your Deployed Website

After upload, test these features:

### 1. Basic Functionality
- Visit: https://heritageh2gp.infinityfreeapp.com
- Check: Website loads without errors
- Verify: All images display correctly
- Test: Navigation works smoothly

### 2. CAD Model Functionality
- Navigate to "3D MODEL" section
- **Expected**: Heritage H2GP Car 2024 loads automatically
- **Look for**: "Heritage H2GP Car 2024 loaded (compressed)!" notification
- **Test**: Wireframe and Explode view buttons work

### 3. Advanced Features
- **STL Upload**: Click "UPLOAD STL MODEL" button
- **Attendance System**: Use secret code "Pagani"
- **All Pages**: Test attendance, login, student pages

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators

### âœ… Website Working Correctly:
- Main page loads instantly
- All images display (McLaren photos)
- CSS styling applied correctly
- JavaScript functions work

### âœ… CAD Models Working:
- 3D viewer shows Heritage H2GP car
- Model rotates and responds to mouse
- Wireframe/Explode buttons function
- STL upload interface appears

### âœ… Console Logs (Press F12):
```
âœ… "Heritage H2GP 3D model loaded successfully"
âœ… "Heritage H2GP Car 2024 loaded (compressed)!"
âœ… "Compressed data size: 18.99 MB"
âœ… "Decompressed data size: 93.32 MB"
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### If 3D Model Doesn't Load:
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify `assets/models/` folder exists
3. Confirm STL files uploaded correctly
4. Try refreshing the page

### If Images Don't Show:
1. Verify `assets/images/` folder structure
2. Check file names match exactly
3. Ensure files uploaded to correct folders

### If Styling Looks Wrong:
1. Confirm `css/` folder created correctly
2. Verify all CSS files uploaded
3. Check file paths in browser network tab

## ðŸ“ž Alternative: FTP Upload

If file manager is too slow:
1. Get FTP credentials from InfinityFree dashboard
2. Use FileZilla or similar FTP client
3. Upload entire folder structure at once
4. Maintain exact folder hierarchy

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Result

Your deployed website will be live at:
**https://heritageh2gp.infinityfreeapp.com**

With full CAD model functionality including:
- Real Heritage H2GP STL model loading
