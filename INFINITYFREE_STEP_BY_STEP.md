# InfinityFree Deployment - Step by Step Guide

I can see you already have an InfinityFree account with a website set up! Let's get your STEAM website deployed.

## ðŸŽ¯ Your InfinityFree Setup
- âœ… Account: if0_39905671
- âœ… Website: HeritageH2GP.infinityfreeapp.com
- âœ… Ready to upload files!

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Access Your File Manager
1. Click on your website "HeritageH2GP.infinityfreeapp.com" in your InfinityFree dashboard
2. Look for "File Manager" or "Online File Manager" button
3. Click to open the file manager
4. Navigate to the `htdocs` folder (this is where your website files go)

### Step 2: Upload Your Main Files
From your local directory `/Users/likithtatini/genai_apps/STEAM_website/`, upload these files to the `htdocs` folder:

**HTML Files (upload first):**
- `index.html` - Your main website
- `attendance.html` - Attendance system
- `login.html` - Login page
- `student-attendance.html` - Student interface
- `hydrogen-fuel-cell.html` - Educational content

**CSS Files:**
- `styles.css` - Main styling
- `attendance-styles.css` - Attendance styling
- `login-styles.css` - Login styling

**JavaScript Files:**
- `script.js` - Main functionality
- `attendance-script.js` - Attendance system
- `login-script.js` - Login functionality
- `student-attendance-script.js` - Student interface

### Step 3: Create Assets Folder
1. In the File Manager, create a new folder called `assets`
2. Inside `assets`, create another folder called `models`

### Step 4: Upload Images
Upload these files to the `assets/` folder:
- `actual-mclaren-p1.jpg`
- `mclaren-p1-replacement.jpg`
- `yellow-mclaren-p1.jpg`
- `yellow-mclaren.jpg`

### Step 5: Upload 3D Model Files
Upload these files to the `assets/models/` folder:
- `heritage-h2gp-2024.stl` (this is large - 98MB)
- `models-config.json`

## ðŸš€ Test Your Website
After uploading all files:
1. Visit: https://heritageh2gp.infinityfreeapp.com
2. Check that the main website loads
3. Test the attendance system with secret code "Pagani"
4. Verify all images and features work

## ðŸ’¡ Upload Tips
- **Start with HTML files** - upload `index.html` first and test
- **Upload in batches** - don't try to upload everything at once
- **The STL file is large** - it may take several minutes to upload
- **Test frequently** - check your website after each major upload

## ðŸ”§ If You Need Help
- Use the File Manager's upload button (usually looks like an up arrow)
- You can select multiple files at once for faster upload
- If upload fails, try smaller batches of files
- Make sure to maintain the exact folder structure shown

## ðŸ“ž Alternative Method
If the File Manager is slow, you can also:
1. Get your FTP credentials from InfinityFree
2. Use an FTP client like FileZilla
3. Upload all files via FTP

Your website should be live at https://heritageh2gp.infinityfreeapp.com once all files are uploaded! ðŸŽ‰

## âœ… Success Checklist
- [ ] Main website loads at your URL
- [ ] Images display correctly
- [ ] Attendance system works with "Pagani" code
- [ ] 3D model viewer shows the Heritage H2GP car
- [ ] All navigation links work
- [ ] No 404 errors

You're all set to deploy! Just follow these steps in your InfinityFree File Manager.
