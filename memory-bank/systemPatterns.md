# System Patterns: STEAM Website

## System Architecture
*To be defined based on project requirements and technical decisions*

## Key Technical Decisions
- Memory Bank documentation system implemented
- Structured approach to project organization
- Documentation-first development methodology

## Design Patterns in Use
*To be established as development progresses*

## Component Relationships
*To be documented as system architecture is defined*

## Critical Implementation Paths
*To be identified during technical planning*

## Data Flow
*To be designed based on application requirements*

## Security Considerations
*To be addressed during architecture planning*

## Performance Patterns
*To be established based on performance requirements*

## Integration Points
*To be defined for STEAM content integration*

## Notes
- System architecture pending requirements definition
- Educational content integration will be key architectural consideration
- Scalability and maintainability important for educational platform
- User experience patterns will drive technical decisions
