# Deployment Fix Guide

## Problem Solved âœ…

The issue with `deploy.sh` has been fixed. The error you encountered:

```
This folder isn't linked to a project yet
```

This happened because the root directory wasn't linked to your Netlify site, but your site is actually deployed via **GitHub integration**, not direct CLI deployment.

## How Your Deployment Works

Your STEAM website uses **automatic deployment** through GitHub integration:

1. **Push to GitHub** â†’ Netlify automatically detects changes
2. **Netlify builds** â†’ Uses `netlify.toml` configuration
3. **Site goes live** â†’ https://heritage-h2gp-steam.netlify.app

## Fixed deploy.sh Script

The script now:
- âœ… Handles the "not linked" situation gracefully
- âœ… Explains that GitHub integration is working correctly
- âœ… Provides clear feedback about what's happening
- âœ… Still pushes code to GitHub (which triggers deployment)

## Manual Deployment Options

If you ever need to deploy manually, you have these options:

### Option 1: Use the Fixed Script (Recommended)
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Git Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Link Directory to Netlify Site (Advanced)
If you want direct CLI deployment:

```bash
# Navigate to your project root
cd /Users/likithtatini/genai_apps/STEAM_website

# Link to your existing site
netlify link --id YOUR_SITE_ID

# Then you can deploy directly
netlify deploy --prod
```

To find your site ID:
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Click on your site (heritage-h2gp-steam)
3. Go to Site Settings â†’ General
4. Copy the Site ID

## Current Status

- âœ… **deploy.sh script**: Fixed and working
- âœ… **GitHub integration**: Active and working
- âœ… **Live website**: https://heritage-h2gp-steam.netlify.app
- âœ… **Automatic deployment**: Triggered by GitHub pushes

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still doesn't work:

1. **Check Netlify Dashboard**: https://app.netlify.com
2. **Verify GitHub connection**: Make sure your repo is connected
3. **Check build logs**: Look for errors in Netlify's build process
4. **Verify netlify.toml**: Make sure configuration is correct

## Key Files

- `deploy.sh` - Fixed deployment script
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration (publish: netlify-deploy)
- `.netlify/` - Local Netlify cache (not linked to site)

Your deployment setup is now working correctly! ðŸŽ‰
